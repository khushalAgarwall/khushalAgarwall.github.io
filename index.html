    <h2>Experience & Projects</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Prompt Perfekt:</strong> Contributed in it with one of my seniors in creating animations and login functions in the landing page using <strong>React</strong>, <strong>Framer Motion</strong>, and <strong>Aceternity UI</strong>. <a href="https://www.promptperfekt.com/">PromptPerfekt</a></li>
      <li><strong>App dev:</strong> Got 16th rank in Code Red Hackathon for our project <strong>CancerScope</strong>, where we built this app for early detection of cancer in 2022</li>
      <li><strong>Automation Developer:</strong> Working on <strong>ReelVault</strong> which is an AI-powered Telegram bot designed to help users save Instagram Reels not just as media, but as meaningful, organized content.
        Instead of letting valuable information—like a recipe from a food reel—get lost in your saved section, you can simply forward the reel to the bot. ReelVault extracts key content (like audio, captions, or summaries) and saves it in an organized, searchable format for easy access later. <a href ="https://github.com/khushalAgarwall/ReelVault">Github Repo</a></a></li>
        <li><strong>SIH:</strong>Secured 22nd rank with Team Vital Bytes. We built a hospital warehouse management dashboard with features like real-time inventory tracking and auto-ordering logic. While backend integration wasn't feasible in the 2-day limit, we delivered a fully functional UI prototype and pitched a complete product vision. </li>
